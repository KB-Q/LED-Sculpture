# LED-Sculpture
LED Sculpture is a a techno-entertainment project showcased at Envisage show at Shaastra 2020. It involved arranging over 1150 LEDs in a 15ft tall 3D metal frame and displaying cool 3D animations and audio Spectrum patterns (using FFT in MATLAB). Our project has been patented for its unique methods of arranging the LEDs and processing of data for the 3D animations.

- LED sculpture report.pdf - this is the design report which documents the mechanical & electrical parts of making this project, i.e., shape and size of metal rods, push-pin LED connectors, layout and multiplexing, etc. It also contains explanations for all the code that we used.
- animations.py - python code for generating the data for animations
- FFT_MATLAB.m - MATLAB code for generating audio spectrum patterns using FFT
- arduino_control.ino - Arduino code which sends the signals to the LEDs
